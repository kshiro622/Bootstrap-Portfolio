# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is a variation on the Basic Portfolio utilizing the Bootstrap grid system and "Superhero" theme. I tried implementing column classes so that the site responds to different screen resolutions. The thing I struggled most with was how to wrap text around an image (like in the About page) when using the grid and accounting for screen resolution responsiveness.
